python = """Python course is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language known for its clear and readable syntax, which emphasizes code readability 
and allows developers to express concepts in fewer lines of code compared to many other languages. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991,
Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming. Its versatility makes it suitable for
a wide range of applications, such as web development, data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, automation, and software development,
supported by a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks."""
